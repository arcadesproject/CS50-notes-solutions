# NOTES

1 byte = 8 bits
int has 4 bytes - 32 bits usually

32 bit = 2^32
usually up to around 2billion, but thats because it includes negatives so is 4 billion  (âˆ’2^31) 

Binary:
10 = 2
100 = 4
1000 = 8
10000 = 16
100000 = 32
1000000 = 64 etc

1 = 1
10 = 2
11 = 3
100 = 4
101 = 5
110 = 6
111 = 7
1000 = 8
